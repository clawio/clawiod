# Change history

## August 2015 : v1.6.5

  Minor maintenance release.

  * **Improvements**

    * Export `MaxBufferSize` to allow tweaking of maximum buffer size allowed to read a record. If a record is bigger than this size (e.g: A lot of LDT elements in scan), this setting wil allow to tweak the buffer size.

## July 16 2015 : v1.6.4

  Hot fix release.

  * **Fixes**

    * Fix panic when a scan/query fails and the connection is not dropped.

## July 9 2015 : v1.6.3

  Minor fix release.

  * **Improvements**

    * Improved documentation. PR #64 and #68. Thanks to [Geert-Johan Riemer](https://github.com/GeertJohan)

  * **Fixes**

    * Fix a bunch of golint notices. PR #69, Thanks to [Geert-Johan Riemer](https://github.com/GeertJohan)

    * Connection.Read() total bytes count on error. PR #71, Thanks to [Geert-Johan Riemer](https://github.com/GeertJohan)

    * Fixed a race condition on objectMappings map. PR #72, Thanks to [Geert-Johan Riemer](https://github.com/GeertJohan)

    * Fixed a few uint -> int convertions.

## June 11 2015 : v1.6.2

  Minor fix release.

  * **Improvements**

  * **Fixes**

    * Fixed an issue where erroring out on Scan would result a panic.

    * Fixed an issue where `Statement.TaskId` would be negative. converted `Statement.TaskId` to `uint64`

## June 9 2015 : v1.6.1

  Minor fix release.

  * **Fixes**

    * Fixed an issue where marshaller wouldn't marshal some embedded structs.

    * Fixed an issue where querying/scanning empty sets wouldn't drain the socket before return.

## May 30 2015 : v1.6.0

  There's an important performance regression bug fix in this release. We recommend everyone to upgrade.

  * **New Features**

    * Added New LargeList API.

      * NOTICE! BREAKING CHANGE: New LargeList API on the Go Client uses the New API defined on newer server versions. As Such, it has changed some signatures in LargeList.

  * **Fixes**

    * Fixed an issue where connections where not put back to the pool on some non-critical errors.

    * Fixed an issue where Object Unmarshaller wouldn't extend a slice.

    * Decode RegisterUDF() error message from base64

    * Fixed invalid connection handling on node connections (thanks to @rndive)

## May 15 2015 : v1.5.2

  Hotfix release.

  * **Fixes**

    * Fixed a branch-merge mistake regarding error handling during connection authentication.

## May 15 2015 : v1.5.1

  Major maintenance release.

  NOTICE: All LDTs on server other than LLIST have been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. As Such, all API regarding those features are considered deprecated and will be removed in tandem.

  * **Improvements**

    * Introduces `ClientPolicy.IdleTimeout` to close stale connections to the server. Thanks to MÃ¡rio Freitas (@imkira). PR #57

    * Use type alias instead of struct for NullValue.

    * Removed workaround regarding filtering bin names on the client for `BatchGet`. Issue #60

  * **Fixes**

    * Fixed a few race conditions.

    * Fixed #58 regarding race condition accessing `Cluster.password`.

    * Fixed minor bugs regarding handling of nulls in structs for `GetObj()` and `PutObj()`.

    * Fixed a bug regarding setting TaskIds on the client.

  * ** Other Changes **

    * Removed deprecated `ReplaceRoles()` method.

    * Removed deprecated `SetCapacity()` and `GetCapacity()` methods for LDTs.

## April 13 2015 : v1.5.0

  This release includes potential BREAKING CHANGES.

  * **New Features**

    * Introduces `ClientPolicy.LimitConnectionsToQueueSize`. If set to true, the client won't attemp to create new connections to the node if the total number of pooled connections to the node is equal or more than the pool size. The client will retry to poll a connection from the queue until a timeout occures. If no timeout is set, it will only retry for ten times.

  * **Improvements**

    * BREAKING CHANGE: |
                        Uses type aliases instead of structs in several XXXValue methods. This removes a memory allocation per `Value` usage.
                        Since every `Put` operation uses at list one value object, this has the potential to improve application performance.
                        Since the signature of several `NewXXXValue` methods have changed, this might break some existing code if you have used the value objects directly.

    * Improved `Logger` so that it will accept a generalized `Logger` interface. Any Logger with a `Printf(format string, values ...interface{})` method can be used. Examples include Logrus.

    * Improved `Client.BatchGet()` performance.

  * **Fixes**

    * Bin names were ignored in BatchCommands.

    * `BatchCommandGet.parseRecord()` returned wrong values when `BinNames` was empty but not nil.

## March 31 2015 : v1.4.2
  
  Maintenance release.

  * **Improvements**

    * Replace channel-based queue system with a lock-based algorithm.
    * Marshaller now supports arrays of arbitrary types.
    * `Client.GetObject()` now returns an error when the object is not found.
    * Partition calculation uses a trick that is twice as fast.

  * **Improvements**

    * Unpacking BLOBs resulted in returning references to pooled buffers. Now copies are returned.

## March 12 2015 : v1.4.1

  This is a minor release to help improve the compatibility of the client on Mac OS, and to make cross compilation easier.

  * **Improvements**

    * Node validator won't call net.HostLookup if an IP is passed as a seed to it.

## Feb 17 2015 : v1.4.0

  This is a major release, and makes using the client much easier to develop applications.

  * **New Features**

    * Added Marshalling Support for Put and Get operations. Refer to [Marshalling Test](client_object_test.go) to see how to take advantage.
    Same functionality for other APIs will follow soon.
    Example:
    ```go
    type SomeStruct struct {
      A    int            `as:"a"`  // alias the field to a
      Self *SomeStruct    `as:"-"`  // will not persist the field
    }

    type OtherStruct struct {
      i interface{}
      OtherObject *OtherStruct
    }

    obj := &OtherStruct {
      i: 15,
      OtherObject: OtherStruct {A: 18},
    }

    key, _ := as.NewKey("ns", "set", value)
    err := client.PutObject(nil, key, obj)
    // handle error here

    rObj := &OtherStruct{}
    err = client.GetObject(nil, key, rObj)
    ```

    * Added `Recordset.Results()`. Consumers of a recordset do not have to implement a select anymore. Instead of:
    ```go
    recordset, err := client.ScanAll(...)
    L:
    for {
      select {
      case r := <-recordset.Record:
        if r == nil {
          break L
        }
        // process record here
      case e := <-recordset.Errors:
        // handle error here
      }
    }
    ```

    one should only range on `recordset.Results()`:

    ```go
    recordset, err := client.ScanAll(...)
    for res := range recordset.Results() {
      if res.Err != nil {
        // handle error here
      } else {
        // process record here
        fmt.Println(res.Record.Bins)
      }
    }
    ```

    Use of the old pattern is discouraged and deprecated, and direct access to recordset.Records and recordset.Errors will be removed in a future release.
      
  * **Improvements**

    * Custom Types are now allowed as bin values.

## Jan 26 2015 : v1.3.1

  * **Improvements**

    * Removed dependency on `unsafe` package.

## Jan 20 2015 : v1.3.0

      * `ClientPolicy.User`, `ClientPolicy.Password`
      * `Client.CreateUser()`, `Client.DropUser()`, `Client.ChangePassword()`
      * `Client.GrantRoles()`, `Client.RevokeRoles()`, `Client.ReplaceRoles()`
      * `Client.QueryUser()`, `Client.QueryUsers`

    * Added `Client.QueryNode()`

    * Added `ClientPolicy.TendInterval`

  * **Improvements**

    * Cleaned up Scan/Query/Recordset concurrent code

  * **Fixes**

      * Fixed a bug in `tools/cli/cli.go`.

      * Fixed a bug when `GetHeaderOp()` would always translate into `GetOp()`

## Dec 29 2014: v1.2.0

  * **New Features**

    * Added `NewKeyWithDigest()` method. You can now create keys with custom digests, or only using digests without
      knowing the original value. (Useful when you are getting back results with Query and Scan)

## Dec 22 2014

  * **New Features**

    * Added `ConsistencyLevel` to `BasePolicy`.

    * Added `CommitLevel` to `WritePolicy`.

    * Added `LargeList.Range` and `LargeList.RangeThenFilter` methods.

    * Added `LargeMap.Exists` method.

  * **Improvements**

    * We use a pooled XORShift RNG to produce random numbers in the client. It is FAST.

## Dec 19 2014

  * **Fixes**

    * `Record.Expiration` wasn't converted to TTL values on `Client.BatchGet`, `Client.Scan` and `Client.Query`.

## Dec 10 2014

  * **Fixes**:

    * Fixed issue when the size of key field would not be estimated correctly when WritePolicy.SendKey was set.

## Nov 27 2014

  Major Performance Enhancements. Minor new features and fixes.

  * **Improvements**

    * Go client is much faster and more memory efficient now.
      In some workloads, it competes and wins against C and Java clients.

    * Complex objects are now de/serialized much faster.

  * **New Features**

    * Added Default Policies for Client object.
      Instead of creating a new policy when the passed policy is nil, default policies will be used.

## Nov 24 2014

  * **Fixes**:

    * Fixed issue when WritePolicy.SendKey = true was not respected in Touch() and Operate()

## Nov 22 2014

  Hotfix in unpacker. Update strongly recommended for everyone using Complex objects, LDTs and UDFs.

  * **Fixes**:

    * When Blob, ByteArray or String size has a bit sign set, unpacker reads it wrong.
        Note: This bug only affects unpacking of these objects. Packing was unaffected, and data in the database is valid.

## Nov 2 2014

  Minor, but very impoortant fix.

  * **Fixes**:

    * Node selection in partition map was flawed on first refresh.

  * **Incompatible changes**:

    * `Expiration` and `Generation` in `WritePolicy` are now `int32`
    * `TaskId` in `Statement` is now always set in the client, and is `int64`

  * **New Features**:

    * float32, float64 and bool are now supported in map and array types
